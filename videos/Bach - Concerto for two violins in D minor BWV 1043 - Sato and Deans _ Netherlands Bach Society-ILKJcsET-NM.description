The two solo parts of the Concerto for two violins in D minor, performed by the Netherlands Bach Society for All of Bach, have survived in Bach’s own handwriting. This autograph dates from around 1730, a few years after the composer had moved from Köthen to Leipzig. Bach composed most of his instrumental concertos in the period 1717–1723, while working at the court of Leopold von Anhalt-Köthen, but this work appears to be an exception.

Recorded for the project All of Bach on October 7th 2016 at the Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ, Amsterdam. If you want to help us complete All of Bach, please subscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/2vhCeFB and consider donating http://bit.ly/2uZuMj5.
